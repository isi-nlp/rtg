It 's the cops !
He saved the boy at the risk of his own life .
I don 't like to be spoken to .
You 've got to be bold !
Go and see who it is .
He 's ready to go .
Did that have any special significance ?

Everything is now back to normal .

Get it out of the house .
Not every man can be happy .
She didn 't know what to say to him .
Tom doesn 't smoke .
Why are you waiting here ?
What did you want to talk to me about ?
I enjoy eating with you .
I 've grown tired of watching this uninteresting match .
We really do need Tom 's help .
The cook put the food in the dumb waiter .
I hardly see you anymore .

I had to climb over the wall .
I have a feeling you 'll be a very good lawyer .
Are you coming or not ?

Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here .
One of my hobbies is collecting old stamps .
It is under the chair .

I don 't understand this at all .
I use this all the time .
What is it that you want me to do ?
Is there anything else you want me to do ?
Can you explain why Tom isn 't here ?
Let me introduce myself .
She was astonishingly beautiful .
I had a really great time last night .
Give him an inch and he 'll take a mile .
She 's smarter than him .
I know her very well .
I didn 't know you were awake .
I 'm a normal girl .
I 'd rather do this alone .
We 've seen drastic changes since then .
Mary separated from her husband two years ago .
I don 't know about you , but I 'm starving .
You cannot do this .
Tom could do that .
In other words , he is lazy .
He had the courage to decline the offer .
The dog kept me from approaching his house .
Tom 's home .
It was a great shock to me .
He does not like to wait until the last moment to do a thing .
The weather service has issued a severe weather warning .
That 's a lot of work .
Have you ever gone to Venice ?
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time .
I 'll never see you again .
It 's just money .
How often do you shower ?
I am a bachelor .
Tom sent money to help Mary care for her children .
My sister is very intelligent .
Wait a while .
The photographs are the only proof we have .
You should meet him .
Be on your guard against pickpockets .
What did you answer ?
Where did you hide it ?
How can I deactivate my account on this site ?

My friends congratulated me on my success .
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other .
I do not like science .
What is the good of doing it ?
Where is Tom working now ?
I don 't go in for that sort of thing .
I want to spend my life with you .
I 'm not really that thirsty .
Tom isn 't very funny .
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do .
I gave up on the idea of buying a house .
There are thirty students in the beginner 's group .
This young man knows little about his country .
I 'll come and get you .
I 'm sorry , but I can 't answer right away .
It would seem that you know something that I don 't .
Instead of going himself , he sent his brother in his place .
I 'm very proud of our students .
I don 't know why I bother coming here .
She hit him again and again .
If you need help , just ask .
I knew this wasn 't going to work .
The bakery is located next to the butcher shop .
I 'll do it in the morning .
I hope you 're having fun .
That really hurts .
What are we doing for lunch ?
They were busy .
It 's one of the best books I 've read in years .
She lives with him .
He 's almost as tall as me .
I had chicken pox as a kid .
In the winter , I like to sled down the small hill close to our home .
She 's my friend .
I didn 't see you come in .
He makes mistakes like everyone else .
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it .
Someone stole my belongings .
I hope this works .
This will be a great opportunity .
Are you guys all right ?
Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small ?
Sales fell off in the third quarter .
I 'm often only half awake .
I 'm certain .
Do you like my T-shirt ?
The dictator came to power fifteen years ago .
Bring a lunch .
I guess I need a little sleep .
What are you up to tomorrow afternoon ?
I 've seen one many times .
He 's just like his grandfather .
The town was full of activity .
At our high school , French is an elective .
Would you say they match ?
It 's impolite to point .
I want this garbage out of here .
She threatened to set our house on fire .
It 's time to clean your room .
I just want to help you .
We can 't do that .
Speak a little louder .
How far away do you think that ship is ?
It was my turn to straighten up the room .
The medicine worked marvels .
The blood test is normal .
Don 't speak to her like that .
It 's just an expression .
You can go out on condition that you come home by seven .
When is good for you ?
I don 't watch TV .
I can stay .
I need to talk to you in person .

It 's cheaper if you order these by the dozen .
Can you come with us ?
He is fed up with my problems .
The kid has a keen sense of hearing .
It 's dangerous to text while crossing the road .
Do you have a phone ?
It is true in a sense .
Tom will be delighted to see you .
I felt lonely .
Let 's begin , then .
Don 't make me hurt you again .
We 're resilient .
Are you feeling under the weather ?
We need to get out of here .
Some people questioned his honesty .
We 're here now .
Are you freaking out ?
I have good eyesight .
I 'm not busy right now .
I like what you 've written .
Not all of them are present .
You 're not dead yet .
He 's an undergrad .
Have you seen him before ?
That was a great movie .
You 're probably thirsty .
We were all at school together .
I haven 't seen you for a while .
Quit acting like a child .
They want us to come in right away .
Don 't worry . They will be supervised .
Our house was robbed while we were away .
I became rich .
Do I have to pay you ?
I could hear everything .
I want to know where you heard that .
I can 't tell you how angry that makes me .
Mass production reduced the price of many goods .
A blood vessel burst inside his brain .
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars .
A dog will bark at strangers .
He didn 't attend the meeting .
Tom gave me 300 dollars .
Did you hear that ?
Can you remember the first time we met each other ?
I 'm glad I don 't have your job .
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep .
They elected her to be the mayor .
I usually eat lunch at 11 : 30 to avoid the rush .
Don 't look at us .

Come on ! I can 't wait any more .
I 'll show you later .
I 've had enough .
Will you go ?
Where are you now ?
We 're resilient .
Read after me .
You 're demented .
What would you like for dessert ?
I 'll meet you right after school .
He looks like a horse .
Please take good care of yourself .
Have you been seeing a lot of him recently ?
Everyone stayed standing .
I took part in the contest .
Stop being stupid .
Would you please reserve a room near the Toronto international Airport ?
We discussed the article I published .
Why blame just Tom ?
Look around you .
Stay and have a drink with us .
Can you call him ?
We become forgetful as we grow older .
Nobody tells me anything .
Many people use ATMs to withdraw money .
It was not always this way .
I don 't think I can leave early .
What color are you going to paint Tom 's bedroom ?
Tom got killed in an automobile accident .
You 're the only person I know who regularly gets my name wrong .
We have no proof .
She showed me her new car .
Gas was escaping from a crack in the pipe .
I saw my reflection in the window .
How much did you pay for the dress ?
What are you watching ?
It was broad daylight when I woke up .
My father has gone to China . He isn 't here now .
He arrived too early .
Mary looks like her mother , but her personality is different .
Whose idea was it to pitch the tent here ?
You 're never at home .
Who did he see ?
I 'm glad to finally meet you .
It 's a whole other ball game .
I 'm just looking out for myself .
I have an ache in my arm .
She passed by without seeing me .
If he should arrive late , you may start the conference without him .
Does that price include soup and salad ?
I stayed there until he had left .
Tom doesn 't seem too convinced .
As we age , our ability to remember gets worse .
I know who that is now .
My mother gets up earlier than I do .
I will choose one .
I 've worked with Tom .
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
Choose one person .
Do you have enough money ?
Don 't talk about my family .
Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
She couldn 't afford it .
You look like a kid .
I ordered you a drink .
What could they possibly want from us ?
She was bewitched by his smile .
Did you enjoy going to exhibits in Romania ?
You don 't have to answer .
Tom struggled to climb to the top .
You 're very tall .
I had to see someone on business .
He left his keys in the car .
I don 't know what you really want .
How do you account for that ?
We all know Tom .

Do you get it ?
I want us to get back together .
He was displeased with his neighbor .
She isn 't lonely now .
You should do all you can to help your neighbours .

I 'm sorry about last night .
Is there a particular way I 'm supposed to address you ?
I 'll borrow us some tools .
Who talked ?
We discussed quite a few interesting things .
Where should we hide ?
Mary is not poor . On the contrary , she is quite rich .
She 's putting the children to bed .
The boy made a paper plane .
How is your daughter ?
What 's your impression of the United States ?
They agreed to meet me here .
No less than 100 people attended the meeting .
I 'm counting on you .
Get me something to eat .
I caught them in the act .
I don 't know what this word means .
I guess you heard about what happened this morning .
Will he succeed or fail ?
I figured I 'd find you here .
Please send this package right away .
I love both cats and dogs .
I don 't have to wear glasses any more .
Tom has never been absent from school .
I heard a knock at the door .
Do you mind if I go back to sleep now ?

He clipped the sheep .
I love the way you talk .
He makes fun of everybody .
Get in the car now .
That is another matter .
How about running ?
I don 't care what you do .
I feel young .
I thought we weren 't going to do this .
We go to the movies together once in a while .
They found each other .
You ran a red light .
You can probably guess what happens though .
I wasn 't going to buy anything .
You gave me only fifty cents .

Could you please call me back tomorrow ?
She was busy doing her homework .
Lie still .
We may as well start at once .
It wasn 't just luck .
I paid for these tickets .
I want to see your boss .
I 'm looking forward to seeing your father .
I 'll be back in ten minutes .
I was stupid enough to believe Tom .
You 're very fortunate .
I didn 't feel like celebrating .
You were hurt , weren 't you ?
All your problems have been solved .
Men are all the same .
Would you like that ?
We share the housework .
I made that decision on my own .
I need a job .
I went snorkeling in a beautiful coral reef .

Is this a duty-free shop ?
Christmas drew near .
It seems to me that she has a tendency to exaggerate .
I 'm not a kid anymore .
I try to please everyone .
Ancient coins were found inside the mysterious tomb .
She broke into tears .
We broke up .
Don 't get the wrong idea .
You 're early .
Are you all nuts ?
We decided to leave him alone for a while .
I have no insurance .
Do you really want to do this ?
I didn 't even know his name .
You don 't get up as early as your sister , do you ?
I would like to see Tom once more .
I think you should leave now .
Tom kissed his cousin .
Tom seems so nice .
I can 't do two things at once .
We went to London last year .

The contract is in the bag , so let 's go out and celebrate .

The day will surely come when your dreams will come true .
Is Tom staying at the Hilton Hotel ?
Choose any one from among these .
Why didn 't you call me up ?
I suggest that we hold off on making a decision until all bids are in .
Perhaps that 's true .
Come over to my place .
I can 't tell you how happy I am that you 've come to visit us .
Your cat is overweight .
Don 't be so lazy .
We haven 't seen Tom in a while .
Where were you on 9 / 11 ?
He is capable of teaching both English and French .
He listened to the news on the radio as he fed his dog .
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go with him to Boston .

Have some coffee .
My girlfriend doesn 't like scary movies .

Some wounds time never heals .
Didn 't you go out ?
They all thought Tom was crazy .
You 're very sophisticated .
The village was dead after sunset .
Be kind to those around you .
Didn 't you hear her speaking French ?
Why don 't you tell me what to do ?
He explained it in detail .
I think it 's a little too cold to go on a picnic .
Just do everything Tom tells you to do .
She 's not the marrying type .
You 've got a pretty good memory .
He 's crying .
Good afternoon .
Could you give me a discount ?
We cannot rule out the possibility that civil war will break out in that country .
Tom has lived in Boston for three years .
How certain are you that he 's a criminal ?
The scars are barely visible .
It was very cold yesterday morning .
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went .
I don 't approve of your going out with him .
Tom is drunk .
It 's redundant .
He is full of ambition .
I don 't want to get a suntan .

You aren 't a spy , are you ?
I 'm sorry I have kept you waiting so long .
Quit complaining .
The house is clean .
It 's not just a game .
What color is your hair ?
Do you want something cold to drink ?
I 'm very interested in learning French .
They called it mass murder .
She 's waiting for you at home .
You 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever held in my arms .
You think I 'm scared , don 't you ?
No one can tell what will happen in the future .
Almost everything has been improved .
I appreciate your enthusiasm .
What did you hear ?
I have been waiting for almost half an hour .
Pay attention to what Tom says .
What 's the most important part of a good education ?
This applies to your case as well .

Could you show me how to use this pump ?
We try to go to Boston at least once a year .
I need something to eat .

Follow us . We 're headed to the nearest bar .
Tom wanted Mary to meet his parents .
I can 't keep you here any longer .
I will sleep at my aunt 's .
We should call the police .
I feel like I know you already .
Tom denied having said such a thing .
He gave me a good piece of advice .
I couldn 't take your place .
I 'd like to ask you to help me .
We don 't need you anymore .
Not all Americans shared Wilson 's opinion .
I think you 're in danger .
What time do you want me to pick you up ?
This happened to us , too .
People once believed the world was flat .
Tom doesn 't talk to Mary anymore .
This train will get you there in half the time .
I 've got accustomed to speaking in public .
That 's all you can do .

I found it necessary to ask for help .
I waited three hours .
I didn 't recognize it at first .
Bring me something to eat .
He sells cars .
I 'm allergic to corn .
Stay away from my daughter !
This is so frustrating .
Do you have anything to add ?
I can 't concentrate on that problem right now .
I just didn 't want to upset you .
Tom doesn 't need to wait any longer .
I live three blocks away .
How many brothers and sisters do you have ?
I talked to everybody .
They say that you never get over your first love .
Do you really want to know ?
Can anyone verify that ?
I think you 're ready .
I found this under your bed .
She 's busy now and can 't talk with you .
The clouds hid the sun .
Are you all set to leave ?
It seems like we 're going to be a little late .
I don 't think being poor is anything to be ashamed of .
Tom must 've left the water running .
She was indignant when I said she was lying .
I think I 've seen enough .
I don 't expect you to start now .
Tom wants to show you something .
Non-members pay an additional 50 dollars .
I have no reason to lie to you .
I am from Shizuoka .
You should take my advice .
Isn 't that a little dishonest ?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
Don 't be so careless !
My phone rang again .
She grew roses .
He won 't talk to her and she won 't talk to him .
You 're very rude .
Tell me what to do and I will do it .
How very curious !
I want a volunteer to help me .
She is as beautiful as ever .
This house is not for sale .
Mary claims you stole her pearls .

He explained the plan 's main objective .
I hate dancing .
No matter how hard I practiced , I wasn 't able to do the backstroke .

Would you come here a moment ?
She advised him to go there alone .
Mary is respected by everyone .
Where are you living now ?
Please don 't go away .

I appreciate you coming here .

He 's my age .
Someday I will buy a cotton candy machine .
He wore a pullover sweater to keep from getting cold .
She likes short skirts .

As a matter of fact , she is my sister .
You 're resilient .
We all die sooner or later .
Everyone ought to be the master of his own destiny .
Do you want me to call the police ?
See what happens when you tell the truth ?
Please open the package .
I 'm sure about his name .
Luckily nobody drowned .
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face .
Tom eats the same food every day .
I motivated you .
We lead a very ordinary life .
I accompanied him on the trip .
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party .
They ate and drank wine .
I 'll handle it .
What does it look like ?
I don 't think anybody can help me now .
It 's time we went home .

Tell me .

Is it a social problem ?
I reconsidered your offer .
I can 't drive a bus .

Have you ever seen a koala ?
Tom has done something wrong .
That plan is unacceptable .
We will be together forever .
Choose the color you like the best .
He narrowly escaped being run over .
You should stay in bed .
We used to be best friends .
We enjoyed ourselves at the party .
Tom had Mary 's undivided attention .
You 're a wonderful guy .
I 've eaten all the crackers .
She looked at me and laughed .
I wonder where he has gone .
A good teacher must be patient with his pupils .
We 're a married couple .
He is no match for his wife .
Trust no one .
Pass me the salt .
It pains me to disagree with your opinion .
What 's the last thing you remember ?
You worry about your weight too much .
We can 't keep doing this .
What an excellent idea !
It was very funny .
Children often try to imitate their elders .
I 've already paid you .

You may sit down on the chair .
She found him handsome .
When is a good time for you ?
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence .
A devastating earthquake hit the state capital .
She made me so angry on the telephone that I hung up on her .
I 'll fix it up all right .
The trouble is that he thinks only of himself .
He is younger than me by three years .
He must be very angry to say such a thing .
The air conditioner is out of order .
He insisted that I join him .
I ran downstairs .
Last summer , I worked part time on the farm .
I want to go on a trip with you .
Do you know how to use this machine ?
I paid attention .
Keep your gun handy .
I have a bad cold .
Tom is no ordinary man .
If not now , then when ?
I slept all day yesterday , because it was Sunday .
We don 't have to go .
So what happened to you anyway ?
I 'm happy with what I 've got .
I was shocked to see this .
I really don 't want to disappoint Tom .
This is for you , Tom .
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated .
Tom volunteered .
The national debt has trebled in the last ten years .
Who were you dreaming about ?
He 's so thin that he looks like a skeleton .
Who knows ?
Words failed him .
Go home now .
I didn 't want to work late , but the boss told me that I had to .
I 'm no fool .
I am impressed by your recent advertisement in the New York Times .
You can 't come tomorrow .
You 're wonderful .
Tests start next week .
He was sick , so he couldn 't attend the party .
I want to see Boston .
Do you use all this stuff ?
I 'm out of gas .
The ship hasn 't even docked yet .
She doesn 't want to play with her toys .
I can 't believe you didn 't recognize your own brother .
He heard a shout .
I don 't feel very happy .
Am I going to be normal again ?
The men go to work .
Get in the boat .
I want to know exactly what you did .
Tomorrow , God willing , we 'll be with your parents .
Tom asked Mary what she had bought at the jewelry store .
Just get off the stage .
The robot was so lifelike that it was creepy .
I want the two of you to quit arguing .
He plugged in the radio .
We 're not young .
I 'm nervous and excited .
I thought you 'd be here .
Are you children all right ?
Your car is fast .
They are loyal to their master .
What was I to do ?
Tom bought a gift for his daughter .
I may not get anything I asked for .
I 'm your new lawyer .
I can 't believe what an idiot I 've been .
Has he gone already ?
No one works there anymore .
Why do you say that ?
Would you mind if I drank the rest of the milk ?
Tokyo has a population of over ten million .
What have they done to you ?
Are you seriously thinking about going ?
Say please .
May I look at that magazine ?
It was very funny .
She did not answer all the questions .
Did I ask you ?
You shouldn 't eat any fish that come from this river .
Tom was unsatisfied with the results .
Tom is the only one not invited to my party .
I 'll say no more .
I was fascinated by her beauty .
Even if you go far away , let 's keep in touch with each other over the phone .
I 'd like to add some information to my report .
What I 'm about to say is strictly between you and me .
Here is your bag .
The sun doesn 't shine at night .
It 's obvious .
This is my brother .
Why are you all laughing ?
The swimmers were numb with cold .
He hurried so he wouldn 't miss the train .
What 's your phone number ?
You 've turned up at the right moment .
She hit him with a hammer .
Tom is used to staying up all night .
I can 't believe that you aren 't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives .
Hackers are adept at getting around computer security measures .
Allow me to introduce my wife to you .
I can give it a try .
Was it cloudy in Tokyo yesterday ?
You 'll feel better .
He told me that he would visit Nara next month .
What other choice did I have ?
She lived all her life in that town .
You should come over this evening for dinner .
I love you and I don 't want anything bad to happen to you .
Could we take you somewhere else ?
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake .
Is there anybody there ?
They went crazy .
Short skirts have already gone out of fashion .
I want to travel with you .
That was great advice .
The light is changing from red to green .
It 's the best we have .
I want to help you get out of this mess .
Tom agrees .
I can 't sing .
They were so happy together .
If for some reason that happened , what would you do ?
He had suffered some failures .
They agreed to start early .
You 're skinny .
They did a good job .
I 'm a beginner , too .
This is all so complicated .
I like what you did with your hair .
Is it all right to take pictures in this building ?
You 've got to wake up .
She explained the matter to me .
I was watching TV then .
That is so cool .
We grow wheat here .
If it rains , he won 't come .
I read this book again and again .
We are moving next month .
This bag is both good and inexpensive .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
Do you have a house ?
Generally , Japanese people are shy .
I telephoned to make sure that he was coming .
I wore a hat yesterday because it was very cold .
We 're both wrong .
I 'm taking it seriously .
How did you become interested in studying languages ?
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link .
We all wish for happiness .
That 's why I need your help .
I can 't find it .
When do you mean to start ?
I 'll go even if it rains heavily .
Hundreds of buffaloes moved toward the lake .
Have you got a match ?
It 's your only shot .
He flew into a rage .
Do you smell that ?
They don 't always obey their parents .
He was also kind to animals .
I slept just two hours .
Tom agreed to be here at 2 : 30 , but he 's not here yet .
I can 't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better , we 'd have been friends .
Please give me a sheet of paper .
She majors in French literature .
Manpower was no problem .
You have changed a lot .
Wait here for a while .
I just showered .

Do you have a date for Valentine 's Day ?
I need something for a child .
I don 't care much for coffee .
I have some shopping to do .
Why don 't you take off your coat ?
I 'm playing with my friends .
I 'm going to need your help .
Are you seriously thinking about divorce ?
We picked apples so we could make an apple pie .
I pretended that I didn 't see it .
It took me a long time to get used to the noise .
It isn 't worthwhile going there .
I really owe you an apology .
They want us to come in right away .
Tom saw a mouse .
The storm caused a power outage .
I exaggerated .
This is not Disneyland .
The most important thing in the Olympics is not to win but to participate .
Tom leaned down to kiss Mary .
Tom is trying to say something .
Would you like to go to the lake with us ?
There 's no way to know .
She cannot stop us .
You have beautiful hair .
I 'm not sure what you were thinking .
We can 't do it .
What is done cannot be undone .
I have a little something for you .
I will choose one .
What 's your speciality ?
Could we have a table by the window ?
Please leave .
He has rough manners .
You may call on me whenever you like .
I feel lucky to have been chosen .
What is the meaning of this phrase ?
Tell Tom what Mary told you .
Can I take your order now ?
Your paper contains too many mistakes .
We will play a tennis match .
I want to find true love .
Your theory has no scientific basis .
I prefer to remain seated .
She is not a nurse , but a doctor .
I think you 're nuts .
I 've been a teacher for 15 years .
Leave me alone .
I 'm going to cook for you .
Tom spoke calmly .
My father drives safely .
It 's freezing outside .
I 'm looking for your sister . Where is she ?
She resides in New York .
She liked tennis and became a tennis coach .
I prefer it this way .
You should stop drinking .
I felt a drop of rain .
Nobody 's in the classroom now .
Please stop talking .
I have a feeling I 've met her somewhere before .
I , too , didn 't understand anything .
I started a fire right away .
Why do you think you 're here ?
Why are you so insecure ?
What do you say to taking a walk in the park ?
I 'm humble .
You 're all done .
Can you afford it ?
Tom thought Mary could do it .
Let me help you with the dishes .
No one got sick .
I 'd like to welcome you all aboard .
Don 't leave the bicycle in the rain .
Welcome home .
I have cancer .
You 're wasting my time .
Try to keep it down .
Pardon me ?
Get in the van .
Take that back .
My daughter has reached a marriageable age .
What scared you ?
Stop !
I saw a cat running after the dog .
I heard you are planning to switch majors .
A detective arrived upon the scene of the crime .
Is anybody in there ?

What did you make ?
Give that book back to me .
I want to be pampered .
Don 't look away .
Look , I 'm being serious .
You can 't just quit .
This is for internal use .
I have never seen a red refrigerator .
I can 't remember his explanation .
I guess I didn 't want to disappoint you .
I don 't date .
I got left behind .
He needed to rest .
Tom always yells at Mary every time she does something stupid .
Don 't let him take advantage of you .
We were nearly frozen to death .
Where do I have to change trains ?
Can I use your dictionary ?
Far from hesitating , she willingly offered to help me .
I want everything to work out just right .
I bought you a gift .
I admit he 's smart , but does he have to talk over everyone 's heads all the time ?
There are many different kinds of beauty .
I like being with you .
Do you want to know why Tom left ?
I lost a lot of blood .
A few months later they return to their breeding grounds in the Arctic .
They 're looking for you .
I never thought you 'd become a doctor .
I don 't need a lawyer .
They live in tents .
Better a broken promise than none at all .
She especially likes music .
Mathematics is difficult for me .
The light went out .
I like solving puzzles .
The store was so crowded that they lost sight of each other .
Are you seeing anybody ?
Grab as much as you need .
Can I take a picture here ?
They like apples .
This road needs to be repaved .
Glaciers around the world are melting .
Ask anyone .
I 'm observant .
They all objected to his proposal .
I didn 't fall asleep .
Don 't you just love a mystery ?
This isn 't too hard for you , is it ?
I wish I had asked you for advice .
Don 't look at me that way .
I 'm psychic .
They 're not coming back .
Don 't forget your stuff .
She didn 't want him to leave the room .
I 'm not mean .
May I offer you a drink ?
He 's not in our group .
My older brother is watching TV .
He is about my age .
He built a new house .
It is cold outdoors . Put on your coat .
Hold still a moment while I fix your tie .
I mentioned your name to him .
I left Tom a message this morning .
You must be very hungry now .
He should have known better .
Why don 't you ask me what you really want to know ?
He 's kind of shy .
She doesn 't know what to say .
I like meat , but eggs do not agree with me .
My uncle died of cancer .
You 're not allowed in here .
You are very rich .
It took us half an hour to set up the tent .
This doesn 't happen often .
I 'm surprised you weren 't invited .
Billie Holliday had an earthy , gravelly voice .
You have to ask me for it .
He was very poor .
I assume we 're doing a pretty good job since no one has complained .
Can you give us your point of view ?
Tom fired Mary .
I 'm happy , too .
I got up early in the morning .
When did he go to Europe ?
Don 't open the box yet .
I can hear you , but I can 't see you .
Hey , what are you two up to ?
Tom concentrated on his work .
I love that dress .
Did you go out ?
Tom and Mary want to learn French .
I believe you 'll get over it soon .
You should turn off your cell phone .
Did I startle you ?
I cut the article out of the magazine .
Can you prove that what you said is true ?
She acted in a play for the first time .
Stop bothering me !
You should have told me that before .
Discretion is the better part of valor .
He didn 't say a single word .
You 're a nervous wreck .
Do you study every day ?
His story moved her to tears .
She is very annoyed with me .
When does he come ?
You should get that sofa reupholstered .
I 'm not done with you yet .
She had the decency to apologize .
That was promising .
I 'm not accustomed to getting up early .
She always speaks ill of others .
Did you stay home to study for the test ?
Despite adversity , the architect achieved worldwide fame .
You 're clever .
There 's no telling what he 'll do next .
I told you I don 't know how to do that .
She listens to religious music .
The story cannot be true .
All sorts of people live in Tokyo .
How fast can you do it ?
The maid made my bed .
You don 't need to do that right away .
What time did you wake up ?
Is aggression natural , or is it learned ?
Are you sure ?
Can you imagine what life would be like without television ?
I 'm sorry about yesterday .
Go back to your seats .
Why are you all sad ?
I know I 'm not the brightest girl in the world .
Tom forgot to bring a flashlight .
Don 't repeat that .
I don 't like it at all .
Do you have a receipt ?
You 're the most beautiful girl I 've ever seen .
That doesn 't make any sense to me .
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn 't a good idea .
I just want my past to go away .
She studies hard .
We learned at school that the square root of nine is three .
You must think I 'm a complete idiot .
I 've attempted suicide twice .
I figured you might want this .
It 's supposed to get colder and snow later today .
Open your book to page ten .
You must get the job done before the deadline .
Everybody makes mistakes once in a while .
I didn 't get much sleep last night .
At last , they came to a decision .
How far are we going ?
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
I just don 't want your dog in my house .
That 's a very difficult question .
In Japan , you never have to go too far to find a convenience store .
Tom said he was calling from his cell phone .
Tom bought himself a new sports car .
Did anyone see you there ?
She liked it .
She has no children , does she ?
A fuse has blown .
How much will all this cost ?
A woman asked me for directions .
She will be coming to see us again soon .
Tom has a secret weapon .
I think this tie will go great with that shirt .
Do you mean you 're giving up ?
I feel so happy when I 'm with you .
Come again tomorrow .
I 'm not persuaded .
He said it himself .
My mother is the first one to get up every morning .
I don 't feel like taking a walk this morning .
You 're very upset .
Let 's hear the rest of the story .
I got off lightly .
I 'm shocked .
A boy snatched my purse as he rode by on his bicycle .
Paper burns quickly .
People who talk about themselves all the time bore me .
I hadn 't expected anyone to be home .
Are you through with your work ?
I pressed the button to turn the radio on .
My friends are all married .
Who 's coming for dinner ?
I think Tom has a valid point .
How many teams are there ?
I apologized profusely .
I will telephone you later on .
All I want to do is close my eyes and get some sleep .
I don 't know what that thing is .
I don 't know everybody .
We 'll find it .
Why do you want to die ?
I suggested that we go fishing .
Tom lay awake for a long time thinking about what he should do .
I 'm sorry , I 'm busy right now .
Tom deserved the punishment he got .
Hundreds of soldiers ate in silence around their campfires .
You 're starting to sound like your old man .
Do you realize what you 're doing ?
Tom doesn 't speak French .
I shop for groceries every morning .
You are hopeless .
The enemy destroyed many of our ships .
I must go to the station at three o 'clock .
I think there 's something you 're not telling me .
Tom was pacing back and forth in the parking lot , waiting for Mary .
Like I said , I was busy .
I think that Shintaro speaks English well .
They aren 't afraid of death .
Who taught you to write ?
I 'm glad to see you in one piece .
What 's it about ?
Don 't be afraid to make mistakes when speaking English .
Let 's go by taxi , OK ?
I don 't want you to lie to me .
Are they still in bed ?
We painted the walls white .
The tank is empty .
Can you still remember when we first met ?
He 's digging his own grave .
Why do you put up with that ?
Why do you despise people ?
Did you tell everybody all about me ?
Are you mentally challenged ?
He owes his success to good luck .
I feel safe here .
All these books are mine .
Who broke it ?
She gave birth to a baby boy .
They 'll kill you .
Keep your dirty hands off me !
He arrived safely .
Follow me and I will show you the way .
She complained of a headache .
I was new .
He can 't read it .
She attempted to persuade her father .
No one knew it .
I 'm getting tired . It 's your turn to drive .
They arrived just in time for the last train .
I like mahjong .
You 're bright .
Scientists have found water on Mars .
He pressed me against the wall .
She asked him how to turn on the machine .
Don 't get off the train till it stops .
He promised to marry her .
I had a happy childhood .
We invited him to the party , but he did not show up .
They were free at that moment .
Don 't put all your eggs in one basket .
I 'm from Tokyo .
First of all , you have to read this book .
I don 't have time for a walk .
You must not make noises in the classroom .
I 'm delighted that it 's all over .
Don 't you think we should at least give Tom a call ?
Do you get along with your boss ?
It 's embarrassing .
A parrot can mimic a person 's voice .
The last time we ate dinner together , you would only eat vegetables .
I must work tonight .
Her car broke down on the way .
She may have argued with him , but I don 't think she could have hit him .
I want you to consider this .
Tom should ask Mary how to do it .
He wanted to know more about the trees , too .
The world is dangerous .
Where will the bus pick us up ?
I want to see your mother .
I didn 't see you come in .
Do you have any aspirin ?
Show yourself .
Legend has it that this house is haunted .
It happened so fast .
That 's the last thing I remember .
Where 's the cat ?
You won 't stand a chance .
I 've never dated anyone taller than me .
She married him for his money .
Germany borders on France .
Can I see you again ?
She watched him dance .
I didn 't take the time to do it properly .
I saved your life .
My success was largely due to luck .
I have to try .
They 're in the hot tub .
He hastily packed his bags .
Let 's go camping .
I have been to the station to see him off .
You fainted .
She advised him to go to the hospital .
Take a walk every day .
Give him my best regards .
You 're being silly .
The place is surrounded by cops .
It 's not sure it will happen .
I 'm in the attic .
There is not much I can do to help , I am afraid .
The cellar is ugly , dark , and stinky .
Come to the party , will you ?
We went for a walk .
Stop yelling at me .
I 'd completely forgotten that .
There were two murders this month .
I hate beans .
We 're waiting for you to leave .
The students made her life happy .
We have run short of food .
I don 't like your tone .
Somebody saw you .
Be more careful from now on .
She looks unhappy .
Watch carefully .
Someday you should give it a try .
Dangerous driving should be punished .
I 'm sorry if I scared you .
The train has not arrived yet .
He is a heroin addict .
I do my homework after school .
I could swim faster when I was young .
I don 't want to go any place .
I called your office today , but you weren 't in .
Can 't we have a snack or something ?
Now drink up .
It 's an interesting argument .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
No comment .
It was cloudy yesterday .
They got married three months ago .
You 'd be perfect for that .
Her voice doesn 't carry .
Getting married is a serious matter .
We 're very excited .
He made up his mind to marry her .
Are you sure you 're warm enough ?
He threatened me , but I wasn 't scared .
We 're not happy .
Compared to you , I 'm just a beginner at this game .
Is it all wrong ?
I expect you to work harder .
He is very angry .
Mary is my niece .
This is a great business opportunity .
Try and do your homework by yourself .
There is no advantage in staying here .
You can rent a boat by the hour .
I did not expect it to be that big .
I can 't stand it anymore .
That sounds too good to be true .
This is the town where he was born .
How is the weather ?
They agreed to meet me here .
It 's important that you understand .
You look upset .
I like to be thorough .
I thought you were working .
Can you help me wash these dishes ?
Are you sure you didn 't do anything ?
He may have told a lie .
I don 't have time to argue with you .
The pain was unbearable .
They are happy with the result .
She speaks Hebrew with her mother and Polish with her father .
I haven 't made a decision yet .
I love your sweater .
He didn 't say anything .
It seems that the store is closed today .
You should be proud of yourselves .
He tried to comfort her , but she kept crying .
My wife wanted to adopt a child .
I want to file a complaint .
His essay was full of original ideas .
Try on this sweater .
I fell for it .
I can 't remember exactly .
The mayor addressed the general public .
No one ate the cake .
Did you put on some sunscreen ?
He asked that we be silent .
I was jealous of you .
I thought you didn 't know that .
It was sunny yesterday .
You seem distracted today .
Would you like a newspaper or magazine ?
Do your homework by yourself .
Why don 't you drop around sometime ?
That 's a beautiful painting .
There are two cats sleeping on the bed .
Photography is now considered a new form of art .
My father is a heavy smoker .
I appreciate your concern .
Do you often listen to audiobooks ?
I 'd like three of these .
That girl has a lovely doll .
She patted me on the shoulder .
That 's no exaggeration .
He lives in a cozy little house .
Is that a threat ?
How tall you are !
Would you like another cup of tea ?
Tom 's been going through a rough patch lately .
It is time to stop watching television .
You may as well tell me all about it .
That sounds like a great idea .
The baseball game was put off till next Sunday .
I 'm not sure I can trust you .
She 's looking the other way .
A horse passed my house .
I 'd like to run a few more tests .
You ran a red light .
I like short hair .
Does Father know you 've broken his watch ?
Why don 't you read it for yourself ?
I live near the sea so I often go to the beach .
After she lost her job , she couldn 't afford to feed her dogs , so she gave them away .
He looked surprised .
I want you to come back .
I thought you were smart .
You can go back .
Don 't say too much .
Can you spare me a few minutes ? I 'd like to have a word with you .
Don 't look for us .
Tom had difficulty learning French .
How do we find it ?
" Will it stop raining soon ? " " I 'm afraid not . "
You are early .
If you want this job , you must apply for it by tomorrow .
I don 't know who else to turn to for help .
He asked us not to make any noise .
Excuse us for a minute .
I can 't decide what to eat for lunch .
Why would you want to leave ?
Money isn 't everything , but if you have no money , you can 't do anything .
I met some hikers on the mountain .
That 's a lot !
May I use your eraser ? I seem to have lost mine .
You should buy it for yourself .
This book is new .
I was somewhere else .
Do you like black cats ?
We never forget .
This is mind blowing .
I wasn 't looking at you .
I just want your love .
You can 't be serious .
Do you know the reason why she is so angry ?
I 'd like to know what 's going on .
You need to sleep .
I just don 't want to see you get disappointed .
No one knows the reason .
Tom doesn 't often do his homework before dinner .
The government should do away with these regulations .
He 's a good liar .
Could you please tell me where the nearest church is ?
I was busy cooking .
To tell the truth , I 'm tired of violent movies .
Why do you want me to wait in here ?
That 's what you should do .
Why can 't we do this now ?
I saw you in the park yesterday .
You just made me miss the perfect shot when you hollered .
Can you tell me why you like him ?
I hate that so much .
Have you ever been lonely ?
He deals in used cars .
Professional translators quite often specialize in just one field , for example law or medicine .
Tom doesn 't believe what Mary says .
I sell clothing online .
That 's the safest way , isn 't it ?
He got his doctorate .
You 're talkative .
Are you through with the paper ?
Are you insured ?
Can you swim ?
You feel lonesome , don 't you ?
Smoking is bad for your health .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
They helped Tom .
Snails move slowly .
This is the cheaper of the two .
There were only six people at the meeting .
Would you tell me when to get off ?
Most of my friends are guys .
Am I dying ?
I thought Tom was at school .
I gave up my job .
She hid the letter carefully so no one would see it .
What shall we do ?
I need some nutmeg .
Believe me , everything he 's told you is a crock .
I can manage .
This is the house where I lived when I was a child .
This doesn 't work !
I guess I 've gotten lazy .
He is always willing to help others .
I want to thank you all for a job well done .
I 've been dying to see you .
Nature is scary .
We hate violence .
I 'll play along .
Nobody cares what you think .
My brother is stupid .
I don 't know what that is .
All the students attended the party .
Tom can speak German as well as English .
Tom still isn 't used to the way things work here .
He knows us very well .
How did you manage to do that ?
I 'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday .
Don 't swear in public .
Any of you can do it .
I rarely talk on the phone .
He took credit for my idea .
Everyone was invited , except for me .
There are two zeros in the number " 2010 . "
I can 't believe you 're here .
In all probability , no language is completely free of borrowed words .
The job offer still stands .
I live next door .
Why don 't you run for student council ?
He spent another sleepless night watching television .
Don 't you think I would like to do that ?
He is nasty .
Come here , all of you .
It 's pathetic .
I hope to one day speak German as well as you speak English .
It 's really infuriating .
Did you see what I did ?
I could 've met you at the airport .
Give me the money .
What are your pet peeves ?
Which dog is yours ?
I wasn 't talking to you .
It 's five o 'clock .
It is no use complaining .
I can 't tell you how happy I am that you 've come to visit us .
I don 't like who you 've become .
I wonder what has become of her .
What is your blood type ?
Everyone is happy .
I can 't help you with this .
There seems to be no possibility of compromise .
He 's intelligent .
I 'm a bit short of money now .
What a pity you can 't dance !
Get your clothes on .
He was hard to please .
I apologize for that .
Tom vanished without a trace .
Let me explain the rules .
Where is the boy ?
What did you do at that moment ?
When did you get married ?
Stop that !
I 'm sorry if I 'm bothering you .
You said you didn 't care .
I cried a lot .
Tom heard some shots .
It 's cheaper to order things by the dozen .
Do you have a problem ?
We need to think together about the future of Europe .
The money we offered them was obviously not enough .
You 're a prude .
I am thinking of my vacation .
It 's up to you to keep things running smoothly .
I didn 't ask for help .
I 'm sorry I misunderstood you .
I can 't believe you 're eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
I shouldn 't have slept in .
Can you put up with the way he behaves ?
Tom doesn 't sleep much .
I cannot help thinking that my son is still alive .
Do you know the man staring at you ?
I 'm not unhappy .
Turn up the volume .
How did you find me ?
A passing car splashed water on us .
Quit acting like a child .
Please refrain from smoking here .
What 's there to say ?
I usually eat rice with chopsticks .
You 'll find the letter under these papers .
These are not your forks .
I can 't think of his name .
There are no chairs in this room .
I still don 't know .
He has a fairly large fortune .
We discussed the problem at length .
They 've had enough .
We weren 't all that hungry .
I think it 's time for me to start cooking dinner .
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital ?
He 's looking at you .
Where 's my mother ?
I can 't believe your mom let you go .
I 've seen all that .
You must know that I snore .
I 'd like to be alone now .
Do you smoke ?
It is fine today .
Look who 's talking .
I 'm listening to BjÃ¶rk 's latest song .
Tom asked me to pick Mary up at the airport .
I thought Tom was sick .
What if they 're wrong ?
Have a nice weekend !
He does this all the time .
I thought you 'd gone and left me .
I remember what I saw .
The fire was so intense that the firemen couldn 't get into the house .
He was too busy to notice it .
I hope we don 't have to wait for too long .
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench .
Tom stepped off the train .
Take the chair to your room .
We found something .
I 'm not presentable .
I was ill yesterday .
You 're conceited .
Tom bolted the door .
He declined the offer and so did I.
How do you assess your students ?
Why did I trust you ?
I heard screams .
I saw her spike his drink .
We 're all busy .
This classroom is very large .
There 's a gas leak .
You 're supposed to help your friends when they 're in trouble .
He did it willingly .
Tom took the scissors away from Mary .
How do you feel at this moment ?
Here it is .
Members of that tribe settled along the river .
I feel a little woozy .
You can 't imagine doing that , can you ?
We could read .
He was condemned to death .
I was forced to take medicine .
Don 't dismiss any possibility .
I called her , but the line was busy .
Just then I heard footsteps in the stairwell .
I have no idea who he is .
The odds are in his favor .
Can 't you see it 's bigger than the both of us ?
Ice covers the lake during the winter .
I wanted to know what happened .
He fleeced three old ladies of their meager pensions .
It 's unusual for you to do something like that .
The administration approved the budget .
She waved goodbye to him .
I know how badly you want it .
You 're not being rational .
Bring him to me .
She is buying books in the bookstore .
Some French fries , please .
Do you know who she is ?
She asked me about my mother .
Tadpoles become frogs .
How come you 're not the boss ?
Why do you think you 're here ?
See things as they are .
You can 't do that .
I never stop thinking about you .
Where 's convenient for you ?
Thanks to you , I arrived on time .
I outrank you .
We can 't go there .
Have you been told why we didn 't hire you ?
A bunch of people were standing outside waiting .
That made me very sad .
These shirts are selling like hotcakes .
My dad gave up alcohol .
Why was Tom killed ?
It 's my turn to tell you a secret .
I want my life back .
Is your baby sleeping ?
I know what you were doing .
He wished he had more time .
How often do you wash your sheets ?
They 're of no consequence .
I love your house .
I really like city life .
They were playing tennis .
You 're doing it right .
She refused my invitation .
It was not clear what she said .
Clearly you 're not interested .
Nobody is paying attention to Tom .
We 're almost out of time .
I want to date other women .
Can you explain it to me ?
You were here just the other day , weren 't you ?
Tom and Mary fight all the time .
When do you intend to start ?
What he said was not true .
He never gave in to temptation .
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it .
We need more data .
What are we having for supper ?
Tom is a good man .
I have two big brothers .
If you could manage to go camping with us , we 'd be delighted .
I don 't like to eat fish with many bones .
Our patient is regaining consciousness .
He held out his hand to me .
A beautiful sunset , isn 't it ?
I like that song .
The meat 's not ready yet .
You 're the best thing that ever happened to me .
My grandmother lived with us .
Where were we ?
It 's the law now .
Hold down the fort while I 'm gone .
When are you coming back to Boston ?
Do you have a son ?
Leave me alone .
You have to be here at 2 : 30 tomorrow afternoon .
Don 't tell me what to do .
You should stop drinking .
I have something to ask Tom .
Tom is just like you .
I don 't know what to do next .
I 'm an actress , not a model .
Do I have to leave a deposit ?
As is usual with him , he arrived a quarter of an hour late .
I can 't believe that .
Have you seen enough ?
You have to trust me .
You 're overemotional .
Yesterday was Sunday , not Saturday .
We regard him as our hero .
I 'd rather walk than take a bus .
You 're bright .
Come on , grow up .
Why did you want to come back here ?
Come in , the door 's open .
Can you guess the price ?
He was opposed to monopolies .
I don 't even know your real name .
Leave it to me .
I am glad to help you .
He is proud of being a doctor .
I want to make you work harder .
The old system works .
It is never too late to learn .
Whether rains or not , the game is going to be held .
I thought we were going to die .
Give me five days .
I studied in Boston from 2003 to 2007 .
His car isn 't here , so he must have gone .
We 've lost valuable time .
How about running ?
Do you drink coffee ?
You 're being bossy , aren 't you ?
We 'll decide .
I know a few words of French , just enough to be understood .
How did you celebrate your birthday ?
I like the slow rhythm of that song .
I can 't believe he kissed you .
You can get dressed now .
Welcome back .
Does she speak French ?
My life is in your hands .
Those are my books .
I figured you could use some help .
Tom grabbed his coat .
What time did you go to bed yesterday ?
To tell the truth , I completely forgot .
When did all this happen ?
We sometimes meet them .
Be prepared .
I find you very attractive .
Do you like singing ?
What 's this smell ?
I feel a lot better .
She advised him to work harder .
He 's getting cold feet .
There are some eggs in the box .
Is this pencil yours ?
Why don 't you let me take a look ?
It 's difficult to feel at home in a foreign language .
The Congress had no money .
Our mountains aren 't really very high . Yours are much bigger .
I just wanted to drop by to say hi .
It 's a nice day , isn 't it ? Why not go out for a walk ?
He 's bulked up quite a bit since he 's been going to the gym .
Isn 't this nice ?
That 's what I think .
You should leave , Tom .
The patient has no pulse .
How do you deal with it ?
Where 's your mother ?
I 'd like you to come work for me .
Eat whatever you like .
You do want that , don 't you ?
If I were in your place , I would not do so .
If someone who doesn 't know your background says that you sound like a native speaker , it means they probably noticed something about your speaking that made them realize you weren 't a native speaker . In other words , you don 't really sound like a native speaker .
Is everything ready ?
I owe it to my parents that I am so healthy .
A hypochondriac imagines maladies where none exist .
Do you speak Latin ?
Don 't waste your money .
You 're silly .
Classical music is not my cup of tea .
Follow your desire .
He is a critic rather than a novelist .
That is what this is about .
My sister isn 't studying now .
I have three dogs . One is male and the other two are female .
You have to pay in advance .
I have a business meeting .
I can 't go on with this .
Please look for it .
I want to live close to the station .
What 's with the luggage ?
Who 's your favorite writer ?
How are we going to pay for all this ?
I was beaten .
Several thousand people became victims of this disease .
I was broke .
Fill this out , please .
Everyone got sick .
He acted as our guide .
The match didn 't take place .
I think about you all the time .
I 'm at a loss about what to do with the mess .
The more she talked , the more bored I got .
Promise me you won 't do that again .
There 's nothing more I can do .
You must be cautious .
Is that love ?
Where is everybody ?
I wish we could do that .
I have a sharp pain here .
I 'm ready to go .
I think Tom is dangerous .
I don 't know how this works .
Say which you would like .
Tom will spend the rest of his life in prison .
They said that it was important .
I 'll wait for you .
I 've got a question .
He was struck off the list .
The cat is playing with the children .
Are you up ?
You 've already given me enough money .
Familiarity breeds contempt and children .
Let me tell you how I really feel .
I can 't wait .
Cover it up .
Could you please tell me again where you put the key ?
The pain is getting worse .
I caught them in the act .
We were late for school because it rained heavily .
Foxes have few natural predators .
I really don 't have anything else to say .
At what time did he leave ?
I have nothing to say to you .
I 'd like you to meet my sister .
I 'll turn around while you change .
I never wanted this , either .
What did you think of the party ?
What was it ?
We made a good impression , I think .
Are you still married ?
How did you wind up doing this kind of work ?
When did you finish writing the letter ?
He will be delighted to see you .
She danced with him at the high school prom .
We 'll try .
I am going to stay with my aunt in Kyoto .
You had better not drive a car .
It 's getting worse and worse .
I couldn 't sleep at all last night .
I don 't like silence .
I came for you .
The two brothers are still alive .
Please add up the bill .
Do you know where I live ?
The job is almost done .
The party was a flop .
I flew to Osaka yesterday .
Drop your gun !
I felt myself being lifted up .
He left the door unlocked .
His finances have changed for the better .
I want you to have my land after I die .
Did I ask you ?
She managed to drive a car .
I didn 't see her .
Thank you for stopping by .
Tom is back in town .
My grandfather was an archaeologist .
Who are you ?
This is not funny .
He has big problems .
Would you like to play tennis every Sunday ?
Sometimes things that happen do not make sense .
January is usually the coldest month .
Mary is a brave girl .
I had no idea .
How 's the weather ?
You 'd better eat everything that 's on your plate .
I 've got something better .
I think we 've wasted enough of our time .
Can you come over and talk ?
It 's not a weapon .
They moved here three years ago .
Humans are healed , but machines are repaired .
Is this a compliment ?
Come the day after tomorrow .
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help .
Thank you for all you 've done for us .
This isn 't what I asked for .
His accent suggests he is a foreigner .
My best friend dances really well .
Don 't you care ?
Could I have money for my piano lesson ?
That 's what Tom promised .
I can 't do this job without you .
I 'm no saint .
I like to run .
I 'll send someone up to help you now .
I was surprised to see so many people at the concert .
Is that a trick question ?
Where did you get that orange scarf ?
I 'm going to get myself some coffee . Do you want some ?
You made my day .
None of the windows were open .
There is no other way .
Anybody want a lift ?
Those grapes look sweet , but in fact they 're sour .
I think you really mean it .
Please send me a picture of yourself .
Is that black bag yours ?
Is that why you want to hurt me ?
I 'm not busy either .
This problem affects us all .
I agree with his idea .
I think we 're in trouble .
On the whole , I think your plan is a very good one .
We used to do a lot of things together .
He is suffering from a serious illness .
You 're very busy .
This is the American Embassy .
Tom always checks to verify that no dyes are in any food he buys .
Write in the date yourself .
I 'm not sure about that .
Don 't come near me .
Let 's not worry about it .
They love this song .
I 've been watching you study .
We haven 't caught the thief yet .
Can you take on the job ?
Instead of going myself , I sent a messenger .
I started crying .
The motor does not function properly .
I feel good after a workout .
Under no circumstances can we accept checks .
We have to start at once .
I prefer spring to autumn .
I have a little money now .
We 're finally alone .
I 'm reluctant to visit him .
I don 't know what I was expecting .
I 'm afraid I 've offended you .
Tom began to shiver uncontrollably .
We can 't help you anymore .
I know quite a few people who don 't eat meat .
You 've never been happy .
By the way , where do you live ?
Tom found no one in the house .
He was welcomed everywhere .
What are they made of ?
It 's only a fifteen minute bus ride from here to the airport .
One is new , and the other is old .
My sister is crazy about tennis .
Let me repair it .
Don 't you want a little excitement ?
Check that out .
I don 't care what you think .
He is a painter .
Let 's dispense with formalities .
I want to speak .
Are you going on foot or by bus ?
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day .
We used to be best friends .
Who did you visit yesterday afternoon ?
Could you go to the store ?
Both sisters are very beautiful .
There is a path through the fields .
They 're in the garden .
I 've got things under control now .
I 'm a terrible writer .
Don 't be scared to meet new people .
The risk is too great .
Don 't you want to know where I was ?
This is surprising .
Can this wait until next week ?
What part is wrong ?
Don 't be sad .
Thank you for your detailed explanation .
I 'll wait till noon .
The island is a paradise for children .
We 're halfway there .
I 'm staying at a hotel for the time being .
Blue is my favorite color .
We remember .
He listened closely to the speaker .
I asked what he was going to do .
My dog follows me whenever I leave the room .
I need a little help here .
I need to find something to open this bottle with .
Tom has been helping me .
Do you want a ride ?
Give me a drink , please .
Did I give you enough time ?
I don 't know who they are , but they don 't look friendly .
Everyone is happy .
You like everyone .
Don 't let the cat escape . Close the door !
I 'm not answering that .
How did you come by such a job ?
I feel funny today .
How is your mother ?
You don 't have to apologize .
They rented the room on the second floor to a student .
Tom is in his room , writing a letter to his grandmother .
Feeling chilly , I turned on the heater .
Did you think I was Canadian ?
Has the climate changed ?
I was good .
I just saw the news .
I haven 't done this for years .
I enjoy cooking , but I don 't like the cleaning up afterwards .
Tom 's big-headed .
That 'll be seven dollars , please .
She urged him to consider the request .
The house where I live belongs to my parents .
You 're not as smart as me .
What woke you up ?
Who put that there ?
You can sit down if you want .
Are we broke ?
What 's so funny ?
This dog is yours .
His essay was concise and to the point .
If I had enough money , I could go abroad .
I disapprove of what you say .
What 's that stuff ?
It looks like the dog wants something to eat .
Where exactly did you go ?
The floor gave way .
Mathematics is difficult for me .
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs .
I finished the work yesterday .
I got remarried .
You 're acting like a child .
I cut myself .
Nobody came .
Don 't be so noisy , please .
I just felt a little dizzy . That 's all .
Donkeys are tough animals .
Do you need money ?
We expect good results .
I stayed at home because I was sick .
Bring me today 's paper , please .
I can 't read French .
I have some extra tickets for the concert .
We have to deal with that first .
I wasn 't sure about that .
Tom has sold his house in Boston .
I still have some doubts .
Does Tom really deserve to be punished ?
Hi ! I 'm new here .
I hope you 've got some proof to back up your allegations .
They were both drunk .
Read the note at the bottom of the page .
I just banged my head on something .
Sweating allows the human body to regulate its temperature .
How come you 're not dead ?
I slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk .
He might change his mind .
My brother is stronger than me .
He doesn 't like to eat fish .
I don 't know if there is time .
Do you know what to do if there 's a fire in the building ?
Tell me what really happened .
I really can 't accept this .
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday .
I gave you explicit instructions not to touch anything .
I haven 't washed my hair .
I believe in getting up early .
Like it or not , you must do it .
Who did you talk with ?
I don 't have any rooms for rent .
Am I making sense ?
I know nothing yet .
Tom is a bit small for his age .
I advise you to change clothes .
They missed the deadline .
I have little interest in history .
People should be the masters of their own destinies .
You have only to answer the first question .
This side of the house catches the morning sun .
I 'm sure that I 'll miss her a lot .
You 're not being fair .
I am delighted to be here .
It is an advantage to be able to use a computer .
It is not easy to distinguish good from evil .
Tom is seldom ever on time .
I want to work in a hospital .
I have time , so I 'll do it .
Tom was getting agitated .
I 'm ready if you are .
I am too tired to keep on walking .
Are you sure everything 's OK ?
If I were rich , I would travel .
Did anybody see you ?
Where did the accident happen ?
Did you do something new with your hair ?
They 're doing it right .
The older we grow , the more forgetful we become .
He tried to solve the problem , but had no luck .
I 'll save you .
Change your mind , if you want to .
What did you just say ?
You 're very lonely .
We want to have a large family .
You 're so sweet .
I think we can do it .
The dog is on the chair .
I 'm pretty sure Tom could do that .

Can we afford it now ?
No , thank you . I 've had enough .
How can I repay you ?
You should be more reasonable .
I made them myself .
You were drunk , weren 't you ?
Some factories pollute the environment .
What an exciting game !
Everyone kept quiet .
I asked him to drive me home .
Languages aren 't his forte .
Try not to be so tense .
Tom never came out of his coma .
He 's just kidding you .
Have you ever given money to a beggar ?
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant ?
Tell me the object of your plan .
What 's the rush ?
Tom disagreed .
Many of the things Pizzaro had heard about the Inca treasure were true .
Who 's taking responsibility for this mess ?
Since he had a bad cold , he was absent from school today .
That doesn 't sound too dangerous .
I believe Tom is right .
It rained all day .
Why did you accept this assignment ?
Will you go to the dance with me ?
Don 't scribble here .
Have confidence in yourself .
I was greatly impressed by the speech .
I can 't do this alone .
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children ?
He 's offered to help .
The man lit a cigarette with a lighter .
There is no chair in this room .
What do you say to taking a rest ?

I 'm not fat .
I found a real bargain .
She interrupted him while he was speaking to my father .
Is this your DVD ?
Look what happened .
I was wondering if I could borrow your newspaper .
That 's not what I hear .
You are , so to speak , a fish out of water .
Unfortunately , the report is true .
Is there anything you want me to buy for you ?
Tom has a funny way of laughing , doesn 't he ?
She has a funny face .
Please give me your permanent address .
You 'll be asleep by the time your father gets home .
I felt cheated .
I caught up with them soon .
Don 't drink the tap water .
I have difficulty in understanding him .
I 'm counting on your help .
Those apples are big .
I thought you 'd left .
I 'm going on a business trip .

He was leaving then .
The trouble with you is that you talk too much .

I am going to sleep .
You have to do it , whether you like it or not .
I have to finish the work by four o 'clock .
I 'll teach you how to write .
I 'm glad things went so well .
I 've no idea .
What 's the date today ?
We could live in peace here .
Are you certain ?
It 's not always possible to eat well when you are traveling in this part of the world .
Be careful .
I feel much safer now .
I should 've gone home .
You 're such a flirt .
He made up his mind to go there .
I 'm not your maid .

What do you think of it ?
She didn 't know what to do .
This rope is strong , isn 't it ?
Tom 's feet were cold .
I lost my phone .
Bring it back when you 're done .
They 're very close friends .
He 's my friend .
Why don 't you eat vegetables ?
You should take care of your sick mother .
He is like a father to me .
Is that why you 're upset ?
He only speaks one language .
Let 's get the party going .
Is it safe ?
From here on out , it 's smooth sailing .
I can 't do what you want .
She didn 't like city life .
He was given up for dead .
We enjoyed playing football .
We discussed the subject at length .
Let me handle this .
I want you both to get them .
In this case , I think he is correct .
Have you ever dyed your hair ?
That is the fastest train in the world .
Just act as if nothing has happened .

Don 't make me stay .
Do you want to argue about it ?
I can 't feel it .
Do you deny it ?
Thanks in advance .
Are you productive ?

Tom is afraid of making mistakes .
He demanded that we leave at once .
I hope this isn 't a dream .
