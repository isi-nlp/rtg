We 'll be here all day .
I give you everything you ask for , but you never seem satisfied .
The murderer confessed his crime .
I never thought Tom would hit Mary .
They don 't like to do that .
My folks used to tell me stories about that .
I didn 't get the job .

It took him several weeks to recover from the shock .
Did you see that ?
I think it 's going to rain .
I didn 't realize the difference between them .
Remain seated , please .
Tom didn 't even know I was here .
We shared the profit among us all .
What do you have against those people ?

You 've got to be reasonable about this .
I have a grenade .
This smells great ! What are you cooking ?
There were many things that we needed to do to prepare for our trip .
I came back home late .

She claims that she knows nothing about him .

They are all college students .
Don 't you like Chinese food ?
I know it 's a great opportunity .
Tom said he regretted not following Mary 's advice .
He proposed an alternate plan .
I know who you are .
Be merciful .
Please give me a piece of paper to write on .
We were surprised by his behavior .
He said he was suffering from a bad headache .
She was about to call him up when he walked in the door .

Tom has never lived anywhere other than Boston .
You 'll never want what they want .
I hope you 're well paid .
You 're spoiling the mood .
We surrender .
We took turns with the driving .
You 'll get over it .
I was saved as if by a miracle .
Do you want to go out tonight ?
He tried to unify the various groups .
Don 't push it .
I like cats very much .
I just want you to think about me once in a while .
I don 't know how I did it . What 's important is that I did it .
I figured you 'd be impressed .
You 're so picky .
It fits on a single floppy disk .
He put the key in the lock .
I must leave tomorrow morning .
Did you talk to your wife ?

I always counted you as a friend .
I think it 's OK .

Christmas is coming soon .
In the cemetery , there is a statue of a snake biting its own tail .
Do you have a part time job ?

Traffic is a major urban problem .
This door is locked from the inside .
I thought you were older than me .
I know why you did it .
Almost everyone arrived on time .
I thought you read my resume .
No one died .
They fell into each other 's arms .
I can 't bear to see her cry .
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders .
You must kneel at my feet , kiss my hand and swear that I am an angel .
Are you a member of this crew ?
He mentioned it .
You should be more careful the next time .
I don 't feel like laughing .
I need a Kleenex .
I think Tom didn 't tell us everything .
Politicians never tell us their inner thoughts .
Judging from her appearance , she seems to be very rich .
I regret going there .
I went to every modern art show that took place in Tokyo last year .
She gave me a meaningful look .
The water 's warm .
Is that an original painting ?
The car he 's driving is not his .
I 'll keep that in mind .
We 're going to get in trouble for that .
It 's time for us to go .
I wonder if this is wrong .

I felt out of place in the expensive restaurant .
I think you 're being a little too careful .
She told him not to worry .
Go kiss someone else .
The chair is far from the door .
Is that why you 're upset ?
Would you happen to be married ?
I know a lot about it .
I told you not to come here .
Don 't make me shoot you again .
Gardening is fun .
I 'm more than happy .
I was just about to leave .
I think they like you .
Your watch is on the desk .
Are you sure you don 't want to go with us ?
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out .
I don 't mind at all .
Tom isn 't joking .
This is his house .
How beautiful she is !
So far everything is all right .
This is theirs .
You found something they didn 't .
The banks are closed today .
Don 't bother to call me .
She must have visited England last summer .
Stop hiding your head in the sand .
Nothing happened to Tom .
When I got to school , the race had already finished .
I 'd like to thank you all for coming .
Relationships built on money will end when the money runs out .
Do we have to be so formal ?
Did I wake you up ?
The rainforests are disappearing at the rate of tens of thousands of hectares a day .

Can you tell me what this is ?
Tom was acquitted for lack of evidence .
You said you were going to handle it .
It 's a big one .
I just don 't understand .
I can 't help but feel a little relieved .
We have not heard from him since last year .
Have you heard that a burglar broke into my neighbor 's house ?
We need to do this right .
We can 't do this without you .
Cows give us milk .
Now this is more like it .
You can 't do this to yourself .
I thought they wouldn 't come .
I didn 't say I liked it .
His grandmother looks healthy .
Please write down your contact address here .
We 'll begin shortly .
They were very confused .
I have plenty of time , but not enough money .
Only you can answer the question .
I can easily touch my toes .
He will be at home tomorrow .
Has he given up cigarettes ?
Lock the doors .
Developing political awareness takes time .
The man robbed her bag .
The poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator .
If you don 't miss the train , you 'll get there in time .
That 's one of mine .
I suggested that the plan be postponed .
May I speak to you a minute ?
It 's revolting .
Watch out for that man .
What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
Don 't be scared to meet new people .
We made sacrifices .
Do you like white chocolate ?
I 'm not interested in your opinion .
Do you feel like dancing ?
You haven 't heard the half of it yet .
You 're nuts !
Tom needed more time to finish his work .
She laughed to cover her fear .
I 'm not certain .
Does this make me look fat ?
I 'm very worried about your health .
How many books do you read per month ?
I hear you were grounded .
I feel a sense of duty .
Tom saw Mary walking up the steps .
I took your name off the list .
Show me the way to the bus stop .
I met him at the end of the platform .
Did you like Boston ?
That 's lovely .
He is a danger to society .
I must help you .
Don 't take it too literally .
I 'm so tired that I can 't walk any longer .
That kind of thing isn 't important .
My son can 't count yet .
Hurry up , or we 'll be late .
It 's hardly raining at all .
I have a lot of things to tell you .
Please don 't be sad any more .
My sister still lives with our parents .
They 'll kill you .
I was moved to tears by the story .
I don 't think you 'll like this .
I am a good boy .
Could you please stop singing ?
I followed the recipe .
You decide .
It 's raining again .
Tom hates Halloween .
This isn 't what it looks like .
Were you happy ?
May I have a glass of water ?
You said that it was important .
I often meditate on the meaning of life .
We 've got enough space here .
I feel my age .
There 's no more salt .
You don 't even know who they are .
I don 't care if you 're busy . Please help me now .
I do want to be your friend .
Before I knew it , I couldn 't see the birds .
I thought that was your job .
I bought the book .
A teacher must be fair with his students .
Tom isn 't really my type .
You are only young once .
Do you know why ?
The following images are not for the faint of heart .
I didn 't know that this was the first time you kissed a girl .
He gave me what little money he had .
Are you sure ?
I opened the door and saw two boys standing side by side .
They 're cute .
I want to make a statement .
You won 't regret this .
There 's plenty of food in the pantry .
He has a hairy chest .
I get dizzy when I stand up .
The dog bit my hand .
What is your idea of a good time ?
He managed to swim across the river .
Are you just going to stand there all day ?
Dinner will be served on board the plane .
It 's time to get serious .
It took me three days to clean the room .
The cat ruined my sofa .
I appreciate your kindness .
This sword has a strange history .
I was born in Kyoto in 1980 .
It happened when Tom was in Boston .
He 's broke .
That 's our house .
Did anybody see what happened ?
I 'm very busy so don 't count on me .
It is not appropriate for you to do this .
I can 't stand her jealousy .
They 're cold .
Somebody must break the sad news to her mother .
We can 't go back there .
Some of these young people have legs twice as long as mine .
What did she buy at that store ?
Tom is writing a letter to Mary .
Unlock the door .
I think you did very well .
I could hardly understand him .
I work in a flower shop .
I have lucid dreams .
This seems kind of expensive .
I 'm not crazy . You 're the one who 's crazy .
Generally speaking , little girls are fond of dolls .
If it had not been for your raincoat , I would have been drenched to the skin .
I ate a hamburger at McDonald 's .
He turned down our proposal .
When will it happen ?
Do those insects sting ?
I was very flattered .
She asked him why he was crying , but he didn 't answer .
I tricked you .
They are about the same age .
Please step back and keep behind the line .
My sister works as a secretary at a bank .
Can you tell me how to get to the station ?
Shame on you .
Will you give it to me ?
Lay it on the table .
You 're charming .
Is this typewriter yours ?
When we are told not to come , we become all the more eager to go .
That was Tom 's plan all along .
I told Tom we were friends .
What 're you talking about ?
Are you satisfied with your job ?
Cars arrived there one after another .
It was his fault .
This is the stupidest thing I 've ever done .
She had the kindness to help me .
I feel so much better .
I 'd like to go somewhere else now .
I 'll tell you anything you want to know .
You 're creative .
Adjust your tie .
Your bath is ready .
Choose something .
I turned off my phone .
Would you like to get something to eat ? It 's on me .
Tom told Mary he was busy .
I can 't tell you what to do .
I 've made my choice .
Whose is it ?
A number of passengers were injured .
Are you still sleepy ?
Maybe Tom wants to sleep a little longer .
The police followed up all their leads , but came up empty handed .
I promise you I won 't do anything to harm you .
Could you please tell me your height and weight ?
If he had gotten her advice , he would have succeeded .
You should act more calmly .
This is my sister .
I 'm too tired to do study .
You 're disappointed , aren 't you ?
May I ask you to close the window ?
I had to get out of there .
I have to write a letter . Do you have some paper ?
You 're not staying here , are you ?
I want to warn you .
I 'd like to get an early start .
How come you know so much ?
Is this 223-1374 ?
Can I interest you in a game of cards ?
I 'm on my way .
Your room is very big .
They said you were fired .
She reminded him to go to the bank .
All are welcomed .
He had the nerve to say that .
Why didn 't you tell me ?
Tom screwed in the light bulb .
I 'd like to ask you some questions .
You can 't wear that .
Sorry , I didn 't notice that .
What will we eat ?
Call a plumber .
She slowly closed her eyes .
I can 't live without a TV .
Tom changed jobs .
Please treat the cat well .
I bike to work .
I learned it in school .
At the party , everybody was well-dressed .
I wonder what I 'll do once I get home .
I 'm asking you for your help .
Swimming is good for your health .
He succeeded in business .
I have to do my hair .
Can you help me make a snowman ?
She spends time with her grandmother every Sunday .
I just want you to know that I won 't be able to come to your picnic .
Without Tom 's advice , Mary would have failed .
Do your homework right away .
The cost of living has gone up .
The rent is paid for six months .
Don 't judge me too harshly .
The police arrested the suspect yesterday .
Do you have a credit card ?
Who 's not coming ?
I 'll make you proud of me .
I can 't do that again .
Here is a brief description .
People can easily tell the difference between them .
Does that work for you ?
I don 't want to go bald when I 'm still young .
Some guy named Tom said he was looking for you .
I 've got to get going .
I use it .
How much are they offering ?
I 'm as old as you .
The waves are high .
I 'd like to build a new house .
He 's stronger than you .
Because my mother is sick , my father will cook today .
Let me get my wallet .
I already have plans for this weekend .
She needed someone who would understand her .
How did this happen ?
Kobe is the city where I was born .
A large pillar obstructs the view of the lake .
She is a gifted artist .
I thought the questions were easy .
I would really appreciate a glass of cold beer .
I 'm mad at you .
Tom really cares about you .
You don 't have to talk about it if you don 't want to .
I 'm happy you liked it .
The princess lay with her eyes closed .
Classes start at eight in the morning .
They forgot to lock the door .
The driver of the bus was injured .
I wish you would do as you 're told .
He collected a lot of stamps .
This should be fun .
Your problem is similar to mine .
You don 't want to see this , do you ?
And now , it 's my turn !
Pour a little wine in my glass .
I should be happy .
What is his shoe size ?
She belted out tune after tune at the karaoke bar .
Let them know we 're busy .
Spain has been a democracy since 1975 .
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals .
I can 't find the right man for me .
Can you do it faster ?
Get out of here quickly !
I want to ask you some questions .
Don 't worry . Everything will be fine .
Set Tom free .
We got ready .
They waved flags to welcome the princess .
I think we may have something that you 'd be interested in buying .
Wait here till he comes back .
