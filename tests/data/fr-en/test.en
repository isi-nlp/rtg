Two years went by before I could find a good job.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
I live and work in France.
There's no point in waiting.
I have no regrets.
You should stop.
We have to do the shopping.
They all burst out laughing.
I heard what happened.
He was learning a poem.
I think it's time for me to show you how to do that properly.
The treaty did not ban nuclear tests under the ground.
Invite whoever you like.
I see they've put you to work.
Come to think of it, I really need a cellphone.
He stayed in bed because he wasn't feeling well.
Monkeys can learn a lot of tricks.
I just didn't feel like getting up.
He seems to have told a lie.
It won't last long.
Will you please shut the door?
All of us were excited with the result of the experiment.
He was like a father to me.
I washed it.
A comparable car would cost far more in Japan.
Let's wait a while.
We both want to go to Boston.
She got up to answer the phone.
They did what they were told.
I think life is what you make it.
I don't tolerate incompetence.
Is this my life?
Mary didn't wear any jewelry.
There was no response.
You'll save yourself a lot of time if you take the car.
I have nothing to say to you.
She accompanied me to the hospital.
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself.
You know the drill.
Don't touch my car.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
I want something to drink.
You need to be careful.
I have a twitch in my right eye.
I think it's time for me to get my own place.
He stays a long time every time he comes.
We're getting out of here.
Cats are smarter than you think.
One of the main products of this country is coffee.
The concert will take place next Sunday.
I'm not going to close the door.
I didn't recognize what it was.
I like spring the best.
Where did you find this?
He got bored quickly.
I didn't mean it.
Can we afford all this?
Tom comes here nearly every day.
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
I know that Japanese songs are very difficult for us.
Strive to be happy.
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
Why are you making that face?
We happened to be in Hokkaido then.
Tom said that he liked me.
She has a large bedroom to herself.
I usually shower at night.
We're not turning back.
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
Consult a doctor.
You're not listening!
Please give me a call.
I don't remember getting paid for the work.
I thought you would come.
My father isn't home.
Who do you think came to see me yesterday?
I want to talk to you about this list.
We have another ten miles to walk before sunset.
We can pay.
I brought these flowers for you.
When did you arrive in Boston?
My parents are both dead.
They relaxed.
He is a member in good standing.
I don't have many friends.
The soup is thick.
My mother has gone shopping.
When was your first love?
He's been teaching for 20 years.
He's a carbon copy of his father.
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
He treats me as an adult.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
I hear that his father is abroad.
The results were spectacular.
I'm feeling much better.
Don't pick it up.
They say there are ghosts in this old house.
It's a personal matter.
He did it not once, but twice.
There was a sign saying, "Keep off the grass."
They fell.
My name is Tom.
We can't win.
I just want to hear you talk about it.
I can't possibly allow that.
I'd agree.
Can we fix this?
Give me something to write with.
I had doubts.
You're going to be very proud of me.
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for help.
The mail train lost most of its mail in the fire.
I want to make sure you're going to be all right.
They should go, regardless of whether they're men or women.
You still have a lot to learn.
Do you think you can help Tom?
I'm not scared of dying.
You're alone, aren't you?
He asked my mother.
I can't do that either.
Darwin changed everything.
He may have said so.
No matter how fast you drive, you will not get there on time.
I never saw such a woman.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand.
At last, the gem was in his hands.
He offered his seat to an old woman.
He's a freelance journalist.
I'm the boss around here.
What would you like?
Find the differences.
Can I extend my stay?
How many students are there in total?
His play was a hit.
He shoved the letter into his pocket.
I don't know how to handle this.
English has become an international language.
He was walking ahead of the car.
You're not my friend.
This is the book I want to read.
I'd like to buy half a cake.
What's the point of your question?
My wife loves apple pie.
The answer is no.
Do you have a mobile phone?
That's really not necessary.
Take mine.
I've become friends with Tom.
Just use mine for now.
We are short of money.
What is it you kids do?
I've never seen anything like this.
I will do anything for him.
Take your time when you eat meals.
I couldn't let Tom go without saying goodbye.
There isn't any film in this camera.
He opened the window to let in some fresh air.
How good are you?
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
I loved you.
His answer was far from satisfactory.
Do you think so?
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I closed my umbrella.
It looks like Tom doesn't really want this job.
Will you join our club?
Oh, please don't say that.
I like these hats.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
I love watching movies that make me think.
I didn't recognize it at first.
Someone should talk to him and tell him what's what.
We'll never know who he is.
You like English, don't you?
This isn't good for Tom.
I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
I knew it was a lie.
Basketball is a lot of fun.
Tom thinks Mary is lying.
I like your hat.
Tom disappeared into the crowd.
More often than not, he is late for school.
He caught hold of a rope and saved himself.
This room is for VIPs.
I don't sleep a lot.
Of all the things Tom did last weekend, he says that windsurfing was the most fun.
There was nothing we could have done.
I'm very impressed.
Could you do me a favor?
We reached the station on time.
Stop it right now!
Just say no.
It took courage to do what Tom did.
When he finds out, he won't be happy.
"Tom's death was an accident." "Are you sure?"
The interview began at 10 o'clock.
I wonder if you could tell me if there is a post office in this area.
I don't disagree with your decision.
If that accident had happened in a city, it would have caused a disaster.
This is our last chance.
Can you read that?
Am I first?
Do you have enough blankets?
He explained to me that he had no money.
I'm not overweight.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
You're not ready yet, are you?
He brought his lunch today.
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
We wanted you.
Will you pass me the salt?
How did you come up with this crazy idea?
We have to find a way to get that done.
How do you think I feel?
Have you tried it?
I was caught in the rush hour.
You obviously don't live here.
She had a little money.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
I can't just leave you here.
What is critical thinking?
I'm looking for the manager.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I need a few more days.
He made a speedy recovery.
One of my neighbors called and said I left one of my windows open.
Tell me all the details.
I thought I heard you.
A hideous monster used to live there.
The prince fell in love with a woodcutter's daughter.
I would never question his honesty.
I just want to thank you.
You reap what you sow.
What do you have in mind?
Nothing in the world is stronger than the will to survive.
She is handicapped by poor hearing.
Sooner or later, I'll probably visit Boston.
Are you coming to the store with me?
The earth is where we all live.
I can't see you without thinking of your mother.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
Is that why you're upset?
I knew you were behind it.
He attributes his success to good luck.
Why aren't you studying French?
My bicycle has a flat tire.
I suggest trying to get some sleep.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
Now they have three children.
I've been thinking about it.
She died before coming of age.
We drink our tea with sugar.
He is walking now.
Look at the size of that thing!
Could you say that again?
Why don't you take a closer look?
This drink is on the house.
What's the matter with you?
Many Americans are interested in jazz.
He is a heroin addict.
She calls him every night and talks for at least an hour.
Tom is always open to new ideas.
You're a mighty good feller.
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
I'll do the best I can.
This clock loses three minutes a day.
I'll do anything you wish.
I don't want to see it.
He should have kept his mouth shut.
Did I give you enough time?
Are you already married?
A pub is a popular gathering place in which to drink beer.
I appreciate you being here.
Would you be friends with me?
Would you like to sing?
I'm feeling fine now.
I need money.
I arrived ahead of the others.
My father doesn't drink too much sake.
We're not perfect.
I'm getting sleepy. I should've gone to bed earlier last night.
Tom looked like a weight lifter.
You look good in a kimono.
Coming here was a mistake.
I want to know what you're doing here.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
Will you answer all my questions truthfully?
Smoking has affected his health.
Everybody expected that the experiment would result in failure.
That's not how I want things to be.
The maid made my bed.
I came with my friends.
There's something I want to show you.
Tom has a lot of things to do this morning before he leaves the house.
Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news.
I looked in the window.
As far as I know, Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
That was wrong, of course.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
I've never seen you like this.
So, do you like it?
I want to take a closer look at that.
My friend lives in the middle of nowhere.
That's not quite what I meant.
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
He promised to come, but he didn't come.
I won't back down.
She was born lucky.
He was very happy.
If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car.
What am I supposed to do?
The development of the computer industry has been very rapid.
He was very old.
I told you you had to go home. Why are you still here?
Why did you try to run away?
It's a small problem.
My brother fell off a tree and broke his leg.
What he said applies, to a certain extent, to this case.
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree.
I didn't know what to say to her.
I took control of the situation.
No one liked President Buchanan's message to Congress.
You should have your head examined.
Everyone is entitled to be moody once in a while.
I want you to find out about that.
That's just what I want to hear.
Don't get mad, promise.
We're not terrorists.
You're Germans, aren't you?
Tom called Mary last night and encouraged her to join the team.
I assumed that she was there.
She caught her breath.
Do you know where Tokyo Tower is?
Don't be disgusting.
Are you the group leader?
It will soon be breakfast time.
That's very nice of you to say.
He goes to bed early but it takes him a long time to get to sleep.
What're you good at?
I prefer that it stay that way.
There was no one there besides me.
I started doing this work 4 years ago.
Tom doesn't want you to get hurt.
They were murdered.
You're right, I think.
They huddled together.
They didn't find the bomb.
Do you need anything?
She wouldn't speak to him.
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
He rested for a while.
Step on the scale.
Mary knitted Tom a sweater for his birthday.
I will not see him any more.
Reading books is very interesting.
You shouldn't be doing that.
Tom held Mary in his arms.
Tom was there for me when I really needed someone.
She wouldn't go for a walk with him.
There's nothing funny about that.
I was absolutely stunned.
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
We all have our orders.
We have no other option.
I think you'd better come back home.
The Titanic sank on her maiden voyage. She was a large ship.
The child came aboard the plane in a good mood.
Let's take your temperature first.
They're waiting for you.
We've got a boat.
It is not the correct solution.
I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix that broken radio.
She wanted to get away from everyday life.
I have a car.
I like to relax with a good novel.
It sounds great!
Whatever you do, don't blink.
My father was about to leave when the telephone rang.
He sat on the sofa with his arms folded.
You said you were happy.
They won't make it.
You owe it to those who are dependent upon you to do this.
You won't believe it.
Let's improvise.
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
They made fun of my clothes.
Lying to Tom was a mistake.
I listened to her story.
I don't know my address yet, I'm going to stay with my friend for a while.
I figured you wouldn't come.
Are you for or against the bill?
Stop harassing me.
It's nearly impossible.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
I want something sweet.
I think you're right.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
I'm calling from Tom's mobile phone.
Where can I buy snacks?
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
We know so little about Tom.
I'm not good at telling jokes.
What trouble can he cause?
Tom wants to keep things the way they are.
I will go if you go.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
I've been busy all week.
Get out!
Rasputin had the whole Russian court under his spell.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
I always get nervous in her presence.
I want to please you.
Somebody swiped my bag.
How do you spell that word?
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
I like living here.
Am I supposed to thank you?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
The girl closed her eyes and listened to the pastor.
I've had enough of your lying.
Tom doesn't like us.
They'll eat those.
They will be safe with him.
I gained back the weight I'd lost over the summer.
You couldn't possibly understand.
Where's my driver?
I just wanted to see what it was like.
Have you called the boss already?
That's where the problem is.
He played the part of Hamlet.
I despise you.
That's not really important right now.
I can do this.
The farmer plowed his field all day.
May I pay with a credit card?
How about tomorrow?
He lives somewhere around here.
The matter is of no importance.
She asked him if he was happy.
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
Let her replace it.
I'd like a copy of that document as soon as possible.
Could you take some pictures of us?
I've never been sedated before.
It never occurred to me that I might be fired.
I share this room with my sister.
Come and get it.
The problem is not worth consideration.
You're fascinating.
I serve no one.
I'm having some problems compiling this software.
You should've notified us.
At any rate, we can't change the schedule.
She made a bet with him.
We're going south.
Are you coming to my party?
Why are you bleeding?
My dad is the best dad in the universe.
She danced with him at the high school prom.
I'm not very good at chess.
Everything is better without you.
Don't let anything else distract us.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
You shouldn't let people use you like that.
We're all infected.
I don't care about any of that.
You're the oldest.
For that reason, he lost his job.
I will have finished the work by noon.
I know exactly who it is.
Tom thought Mary was kidding.
I saw a dirty dog coming into the garden.
I saw Tom in the park.
Tom loves playing the piano.
Please lie on your stomach.
They all knew.
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?
I will write letters to you as often as I can.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
We're very excited about that.
I don't like feeling so powerless.
I figure that she will succeed in her business.
I have relatives in Milan.
I just want to die.
I'm not tired at all.
He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics.
Let's not get that carried away.
He had been walking for hours.
I had a good opinion of her.
Thanks for your help.
Who is the man sitting in the corner?
Tom was wondering how he was supposed to get around without a car.
Tom never got caught.
Little lights were blinking on and off in the distance.
He lives apart from his parents.
The government should invest more money in industry.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
