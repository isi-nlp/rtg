[#dev-env]
== Development Environment:

=== Run Tests

Test cases are done using the link:https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/[`pytest`] framework.
It can be installed using `pip install pytest`

All tests should be run from the root dir of the project.


1. Run all tests, with minimal outputs: `python -m pytest`
2. Run all tests and also see STDOUT/STDERR `python -m pytest -s`
3.  Run a specific test such as `python -m pytest  -s -k 'test_pipeline_transformer'`

> TODO: add more tests to `tests` directory.

IDE Setup:

* link:https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pytest.html[Configure Pytest as test framework in PyCharm]


=== Adding a new model

1. Go to link:../rtg/module/[`rtg.module`] and create a new `.py` file
2. Create a class say `MyModel` that extends either link:../rtg/module/__init__.py[`NMTModel` or `Model`]
  . it should implement required methods including  `make_model(cls, ...)` and property `model_type`
  . Note down the identifier that is returned in `model_type`; It should be unique
  . refer to link:../rtg/module/tfmnmt.py[`tfmnmt`]
3. register the `model_type`  in the link:../rtg/registry.py[`registry.py`]
. `factories` used to create an instance of model. This would be unique to your model.
. `trainers` used to decide what trainer to use.
. `generators` used by decoder
. If your model is similar to existing model and match most of its API, you should reuse one of those
trainers and generators.

> TODO: simplify this; use decorators to register directly from class
