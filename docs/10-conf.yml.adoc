[#conf]
== RTG *`conf.yml`* File

The key component of RTG toolkit is a `conf.yml`. As the name suggest - it is a YAML file containing configuration
of experiment.
Before we try to understand what goes into a configuration file, let us review the high level entities:

* Experiment - the top level entity that wraps everything below, for the sake of reproducibility.
* Data Preparation - NLP datasets require preparation of textual data. Typically, creation of
vocabulary to map text into sequence of integers. Here we can specify type of encoding scheme
such as BPE/char/words, and vocabulary size.
* Model - model is neural net for NMT or LM tasks. Here we
* Optimizer - Optimizer and optimization criteria
* Trainer - training steps, batch size etc
* Tester [Optional] -- testing to do post training
** Tuner [Optional] - to search for beam size, length penalty etc
** Decoder - the Beam decoder parameters, maybe overwritten by Tuner
** Suite - a set of source and reference file pairs, for computing BLEU scores

[#conf-early-stop]
=== Early stop
Add the below piece of config to `trainer` to enable early stop on convergence.
[source,yaml]
----
trainer:
  ....           # other args
  steps: 100000      # steps is treated as max steps
  checkpoint: 1000   # validate every these many steps
  early_stop:       # remove this block to disable
    enabled: true   # or, alternatively flip this to disable;
    by: loss        # stop by validation loss (default); TODO: add BLEU
    patience: 5     # how many validations to wait, to be sure of stopping; each validation is per check_point steps
    min_steps: 8000  # minimum steps to wait before test for early stop;
    signi_round: 3   # significant in 'by' value, used as round(value, signi_round).
                     # e.g. round(1/3, 3) = 0.333; round(100/3, 0) = 33; round(100/3, -1) = 30.0

----

[#conf-optim]
=== Optimizer

By default, we use the `ADAM` optimizer from
link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980[Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization].
It is also possible to use `ADAMW` from link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101[Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization],
since weight decay is different in optimizers with variable step sizes.


An alternative optimizer may look like:
[source,yaml]
----
optimizer:
  name: adamw
  args:
    betas:
    - 0.9
    - 0.98
    eps: 1.0e-09
    lr: 0.0005   # this doesnt matter, see "schedule"
    weight_decay: 1e-3

schedule:
  name: inverse_sqrt
  args:
    warmup: 4000
    peak_lr: 0.0005

----

[#conf-finetune]
=== Fine Tuning

We define fine tuning as the act of changing the training data at certain time step in the training process.
To enable this feature, we need to do following.

Step1. specify, `finetune_src` `finetune_tgt` in the `prep` block as follows
[source,yaml]
----
prep: # data preparation
  ....
  train_src: wmt_data/data/de-en/europarl-v9.de-en.de.tok   # training data
  train_tgt: wmt_data/data/de-en/europarl-v9.de-en.en.tok
  finetune_src: wmt_data/data/de-en/finetune.de-en.de.tok   # Finetuning data
  finetune_tgt: wmt_data/data/de-en/finetune.de-en.en.tok
  valid_src: wmt_data/data/dev/newstest2013.de.tok
  valid_tgt: wmt_data/data/dev/newstest2013.en.tok
----
Step2, Inform the Trainer to continue training, edit the `trainer` block with `finetune_steps`.
[source,yaml]
----
trainer:
  batch_size: 12000        # training batch size
  steps: 200000           # how many steps to train
  finetune_steps: 300000 # fine tuning steps.
  finetune_batch_size: 1024  # fine tuning batch_size; optional; default is training batach_size

----
This makes the trainer use `train_{src,tgt}` for 0 - 200k steps,  followed by `finetune_{src,tgt}`
for 200k-300k steps. Note that `finetune_steps > steps` .

[#conf-parent-child]
=== Parent-Child Transfer
To initialize from another compatible model as parent, add `parent:` specification to conf.yml as shown below:
[source,yaml]
----
model_type: tfmnmt
model_args:
  # will be inherited from parent  ; see parent.mode.args: true
parent:
  experiment: <path/to/experiment/dir>
  vocab:
    shared: shared       # for reusing the shared vocab
    #src: src            # for separate vocabs
    #tgt: tgt
  shrink: true        # shrink vocabularies and embeddings to child data
                      # specified in train_{src,tgt} and mono_{src,tgt}
  model:
    args: true          # update/overwrite the model_args of child with the parent
    ensemble: 5         # how many checkpoints of parent to ensemble, to obtain initial state
# ... rest of the config such as prep, trainer etc
----

[#conf-freeze-wt]
=== Freezing some parts of model
Frozen weights associated to parts of network means the weights remain unmodified during the course of the training.
It is a useful feature when the model weights are initialized from a well trained parent model.
WKT Optimizer is the one that modifies model's parameters according to their gradients.
Therefore, to freeze the weights implies excluding the weights from optimizer.
Or alternatively, explicitly mention the parts of the model needs to be trained (i.e. updated by optimizer).

Here is an example -- comment or remove the parts that you wish to freeze in the below 6 layer network.
[source,yaml]
----
optimizer:
  name: adam
  args:
    ....# the usual args for optimizer
  trainable:  # trainable parameter
    include: # only include these and exclude everything else not listed here
    - src_embed
    - tgt_embed
    - generator
    - 'encoder:0,1,2,3,4,5'  # the numbers are layer indices starting from 0
    - 'decoder:0,1,2,3,4,5'  # the numbers are layer indices starting from 0
----
TODO: add support for `exclude` logic i.e., include everything else except the mentioned.

This feature is supported only in `AbstractTransformerNMT` and all of its children.
If you are adding a new `NMTModel` or customising this feature, please override `get_trainable_parameters(self, include, exclude)` function to support this feature.

[#conf-share-data]
=== Sharing Data between Experiments

In the new experiment config, add `same_data` to reference parent experiment from which the data
should be reused for training and validation. Note that this uses the same vocabulary as parent.
The child experiment creates a symbolic link to parent experiments data (instead of copying,
to reduce the disk space).

Alternatively, you may use `rtg-fork --data` to fork an experiment with same data,
where the forked experiment will have symbolic link to parent's data.

[source,yaml]
----

prep:
  same_data: path/to/prior/experiment_dir

----

[#conf-vocab]
=== Vocabulary Preprocessing

link:https://github.com/google/sentencepiece[Google's sentencepiece] is an awesome lib for
preprocessing the text datasets.
We've used sentencepiece's python API since day-1 of RTG and it is the default library.
However, since the core sentencepiece is written in C++, it was hard to modify to explore some new
ideas on BPE (without knowing C++). So, we reimplemented BPE in pure python, with advanced
datastructures such as linked-lists, prefix tries and dirty-maxheap to match the speed.
Our reimplementation is named as link:https://github.com/isi-nlp/nlcodec/[NLCodec].
NLCoded can be enabled as:

[source, yaml]
----
prep:
  ....
  codec_lib: nlcodec  # default is sentpiece
----

==== Vocabulary Types
Both `sentpiece` or `nlcodec` support `pieces=` `bpe`, `char`, `word`.

[source, yaml]
----
prep:
  ....
  codec_lib: nlcodec  # other option: sentpiece
  pieces: bpe         # other options: char, word
----
As of now, only `sentpiece` supports `pieces=unigram`.
For classification experiments, `nlcodec` supports `pieces=class`

==== Character coverage

For `bpe` and `char` vocabulary types, a useful trick is to exclude low frequency character and mark them as `UNK's`.
Usually expressed as percentage of character coverage in training corpus.
Sentencepiece's default (when we last checked) is 99.95% ie 0.9995.
Here is how to set this for eg to 99.99% i.e. 0.9999 in `nlcodec`
[source, yaml]
----
prep:
  ....
  codec_lib: nlcodec      # other option: sentpiece
  pieces: bpe             # other options: char, word
  char_coverage: 0.9999
----

=== Sub-Word Regularization

When using `codec_lib: nlcodec` and `pieces: bpe`, you have the option to add  sub-word regularization to your training.
Normally, text is split into the fewest tokens necessary to represent  the sequence (greedy split).
By occasionally splitting some tokens into its constituents (suboptimal split),  we can represent the same sequence many ways.
This allows us to leverage less data more effectively.

[source, yaml]
----
trainer:
  ....
  split_ratio: 0.1        # 10% chance to suboptimally split (recursive)
  dynamic_epoch: true     # Recompute splits for each epoch
----

[#avoid-oom]
== Avoiding Out-of-Memory

Out-of-memory is pretty common, and we have worked out ways to avoid that situation as much as possible.

=== Trainer Memory
Let's visualize the total required memory for training a model in the order of a 4D tensor: `[ ModelDim x Batch x SequenceLength x Vocabulary]`

- Model dim is often fixed. We dont do anything fancy here.
- Vocabulary size is often fixed too. We dont do anything fancy here.
If you can use smaller target vocabulary, it greatly reduces memory consumption.
Sometimes, especially when training data is less, https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02334[using smaller target vocabulary  such as 8K is actually best thing to do!]


So, we are left with `Batch x SequenceLength` as two dims that we can manipulate.

For *SequenceLength*, set `trainer.init_args.chunk_size` to a smaller value to break down whole sequence into smaller chunks.
This operation does not affect gradients, but affects training time. Smaller chunk_size => less memory, but it also means more chunks => more time.
Also note that the `prep.src_len` and `prep.tgt_len` allows you to decide maximum length of source and target sequences.
When combined that with `prep.truncate=True`, all longer sequences will be truncated, or `prep.truncate=False` causes the longer sequences to be dropped.

Regarding *Batch*, there are some things you can do.

1. If you have GPUs with larger memory, use them. For example, V100 with 32GB is much better than 1080 Ti with 11GB.
2. If you dont have larger GPU, but you have many smaller GPUs, use many them by setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable to comma separated list of GPU IDs.
  The built in `DataParallel` module divides batches into multiple GPUs => reduces total memory needed on each GPU.
3. If you dont have multiple GPUs, use `trainer.init_args.grad_accum`.  eg. if you set `grad_accum=2`, the effective `batch_size` is `2 * batch_size`.


In summary, to make best out of your GPUs, adjust `trainer.init_args.chunk_size`, `trainer.init_args.grad_accum`, and `trainer.batch_size`.
I suggest using `gpustat -i 0.5`, look at the GPU RAM usage and see if you need to increase or decrease some parameters.

Regarding the CPU RAM, we usually need as much as a single GPU RAM.
But if you have a plenty of it, please enable `trainer.keep_in_mem=True` to reduce disk IO.
This `keep_in_mem` parameter informs the trainer to load training data once and hold it in CPU RAM during the course of training.


=== Decoder Memory

Since beam decoder is used, let's visualize memory as `[Batch x Beams x Vocabulary x SequenceLength]`

- `tester.decoder.beam_size` : Number of beams to be used. You may reduce it, e.g. beam_size=4 if often a good value.
- `tester.decoder.batch_size` for 1 beam. internally, it calculates, effective = batch_size/beam_size
- `tester.decoder.max_len` is a relative length. It decides how long the target sequence can grow in relation to source length. For example, max_len=50 => len(src) + 50

`rtg-decode` has `--max-src-len` argument which can be used to hard limit the max length of source sentences.
`--max-src-len` can be degrade test performance since it drops out words.
Right thing to do for long sequences will be to split long sentences in input and merge the outputs after decoding.
