== Overview

https://github.com/isi-nlp/rtg[Reader-Translator-Generator (RTG)^] is a Neural Machine Translation toolkit based on pytorch.

* link:versions.html[_See all versions_^]
* Demo: 500-Eng multilingual NMT: http://rtg.isi.edu/many-eng/


=== Features
* Reproducible experiments: one `conf.yml`  that has everything -- data paths, params, and
   hyper params -- required to reproduce experiments.
*  Pre-processing options: https://github.com/google/sentencepiece[sentencepiece^] or https://github.com/isi-nlp/nlcodec[nlcodec^] (or add your own)
**  word/char/bpe etc types
** shared vocabulary, separate vocabulary
*** one-way, two-way, three-way tied embeddings
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762[Transformer model from "Attention is all you need"^]
** Automatically detects and parallelizes across multi GPUs
*** Lot of varieties of transformer: width varying, skip transformer etc configurable from YAML files
*** https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf[RNN based Encoder-Decoder^] with https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/emnlp15_attn.pdf[Attention^]. (No longer using it, but it's available for experimentation)
* Language Modeling: RNN, Transformer
* And more ...
** Easy and interpretable code (for those who read code as much as papers)
** Object Orientated Design. (Not too many levels of functions and function factories like Tensor2Tensor)
** Experiments and reproducibility are main focus. To control an experiment you edit an YAML file that is inside the experiment directory.
** Where ever possible, prefer https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Convention_over_configuration[convention-over-configuration^]. Have a look at this experiment directory structure (below).

=== Google Colab Example

=== Setup

image:https://badge.fury.io/py/rtg.svg["PyPI version", link="https://badge.fury.io/py/rtg"]

----
pip install rtg
----

==== Development Setup:

NOTE: This mode of setup is required only if you are developing (i.e. modifying RTG code).
If you are planning to use RTG without modifying source code, then `pip install rtg` should be all you need.

While most users are
Add the root of this repo to `PYTHONPATH` or install it via `pip --editable`


There are two versions of code:

* https://github.com/isi-nlp/rtg
* https://github.com/isi-nlp/rtg-in

Both `rtg` and `rtg-in` have the same code on their `master` branches.
`rtg` has stable code base and meant to be used by anyone, so it is recommended for the new users.
`rtg-in` is internal to ISI NLP with some unfinished/work-in progress ideas (maybe unpublished), with issues and pull-requests by members of USC ISI team, and often less stable.
We sync both code bases often (`sync-xt.sh` at the root of the repo).
If you like to collaborate with us and/or to get access to `rtg-in`, email https://isi.edu/~tg[TG^] or https://isi.edu/~jonmay[Jonathan May^].


[Source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/isi-nlp/rtg.git
cd rtg                # go to the code

conda create -n rtg python=3.7   # creates a conda env named rtg
conda activate rtg       # activate it


pip install --editable .
# The requirements are in setup.py; you may customize it if you wish

export PYTHONPATH=$PWD # or add it to PYTHONPATH
----

==== Requirements
NOTE: The required libraries are automatically installed by `pip`, so manual installation is not required.
We are listing the requirements here for informative purposes only.

NOTE: To view or modify the  version numbers of libraries, please go to `setup.py` at the root of this project.

The following libraries are used:

.Table Summary of CLI tools
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| **Library**  | **Purpose**
| torch        | deep learning library
| tensorboard  | logging and visualizing training and validation losses
| sacrebleu    | BLEU scorer
| sacremoses   | tokenization and detokenization
| tqdm         | Progress bar
| ruamel.yaml  | configuration management
| sentencepiece | (optional) vocabulary creation using word, char, BPE
| nlcodec       |  (optional) similar to `sentencepiece`, but easily customizable; scales to big datasets using pyspark, offers efficient storage of encoded parallel data
| flask, jinja  |  (optional) HTTP API and web interface for serving the models
| pyspark       |  (optional) parallelized data preparation (using `nlcodec`) for massive datasets.

Thanks to all the awesome developers of these above tools.


=== Usage

Refer to `scripts/rtg-pipeline.sh` bash script and `examples/transformer.base.yml` file for specific examples.

The pipeline takes source (`.src`) and target (`.tgt`) files. The sources are in one language and the targets in another. At a minimum, supply a training source, training target, validation source, and validation target. It is best to use `.tok` files for training. (`.tok` means tokenized.)

Example of training and running a mdoel:

[source, bash]
----
# if you wish to disable gpu, unset
# export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=

python -m rtg.pipeline experiments/sample-exp/

# or use CLI tool installed by pip install
rtg-pipe experiments/sample-exp/

# or use shell script, edit it to your needs, to submit to Slurm/SGE
scripts/rtg-pipeline.sh -d experiments/sample-exp/ -c experiments/sample-exp/conf.yml

# Then to use the model to translate something:
# (VERY poor translation due to small training data)
echo "Chacun voit midi à sa porte." | python -m rtg.decode experiments/sample-exp/
