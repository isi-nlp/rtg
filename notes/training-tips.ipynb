    "Loss of each batch is computed per target token on the target (and then normalized). Thus each token on the target side provides a supervision signal to the optimizer.\n",

    "\n",
    "But in practice, we deal with unequal length sequences so we add padding at then end and mask them during the the loss calculation. Every padded token is therefore a waste of computation, so we have to minimize them. And also, it is a loss of opportunity: if it was a useful token, it could have provided a supervision signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we make batches by counting the number of sentences, some of them will be full, but many of them will be shorter. We could reduce the padding by sorting by length. But shorter sentences thus yield very little signal since they have few tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of batching by sentence count, we shall batch by token count on the target side.\n",
    "This guarantees that each batch's loss is over approximately same number of tokens (maybe helpful to the optimizer).\n",

    "- We can minimize the wasted computation by minimizing the padded tokens. How? By making batches such that sentences have same number of target tokens.\n",
